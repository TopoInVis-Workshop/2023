**Title: Visualising Symmetry with Topology**

_Professor Vanessa Robins, Australian National University_

<b>Abstract:</b> One of my ongoing research projects involves studying periodic spatial structures such as crystalline frameworks, triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) and tiling patterns [1]. Some time ago, colleagues working in soft condensed matter conjectured that a certain family of TPMS were ‘the most symmetric’ and that this is one reason for their predominance in nature [2].  I posed this question to a 3-manifold topologist and within a few months he had devised a proof and found other examples with the same symmetry but knotted [3]. Eventually, I learned the secret to their insight was a visualisation of quotient spaces associated to the crystallographic space groups [4]. This talk will explain what these quotient spaces are, what they lack and how they might help us to understand and design periodic spatial structures.

Vanessa Robins (Ph.D., University of Colorado, Boulder, Applied Mathematics, 2000) is an Australian applied mathematician whose research interests include computational topology, image processing, and the structure of granular materials. She is an Associate Professor in the Research School of Physics at the Australian National University, where she held an ARC Future Fellowship from 2014 to 2019. In November 2020, she was interviewed by Prof Liz Bradley as part of the inaugural interview series for the AATRN (Applied Algebraic Topology Research Network).
